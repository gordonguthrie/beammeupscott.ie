In the past year, [Reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) has become one of the hottest terms in the software development community - describing as it does applications that are:

* responsive
* resilient
* elastic
* message-driven

But what does it meanin practice, and how can developers leverage the core concepts to create applications that meet the standard of being Reactive? 

This talk will answer those questions, as well as provide insight about various tools and platforms that can be used to build such applications, including:

* Reactive Extensions
* Erlang
* Node.js
* Vert.x
* Play Framework
* Akka
* and more

*Jamie Allen* is the Senior Director of Global Servies for Typesafe, the company behind the Scala programming language, Akka concurrency toolkit and Play web framework.  Jamie has been coding in Scala and actor-based systems since 2009, and is the author of _Effective Akka_ book from Oâ€™Reilly as well as the coauthor of the upcoming _Reactive Design Patterns_ book from Manning.
